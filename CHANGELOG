Version 1.2 - 2024-10-09
 - Rebrand from "Fancy Speed Test" to "Open Source Speed Test"
 - Change http:// links to https://

Version 1.1 - 2006-02-06 - Lots of work today
 - Added a lot of improvements to make it easier to integrate into an
   existing site.
 - Moved some CSS values into style.css and added a image_path config variable
   to define where the images are at
 - Added support for a footer.html, and moved some of the content around
   so that this works correctly

Version 1.0 - 2006-02-06 - Initial Public Release
